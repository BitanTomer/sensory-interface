# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners (currently, [oferb](https://github.com/oferb)) of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## General instuctions
As of now, all our code is client side. We use Typescript, and compile it into js files. The generated js files are also stored in the repo.
You could say that's redundant, but, it's still a small project and we think it's simpler that way.

### Very important point about simplicity
We strongly prefer simple solutions and in general keeping everything as simple as possible.
That includes any developer setup or knowledge needed by the developer to work on the project.
It also includes dependencies, tools, processes, integrations with external services and so on.

Please keep that in mind when working on the project. We value any input, and welcome any discussions on adding new things,
but please bear this in mind so you won't get disappointed or discouraged if we don't add something you propose
(or that you will need to do some more convincing than perhaps usual).


## Pull Request Process
All changes should be approved prior to merging to `master`, by one of the project owners.
