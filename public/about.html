    <h2> About Sensory interface</h2>
    <p>
        The Sensory Interface project aims to help people with certain disabilities (visual impairment, dyscalculia,
        ADHD) understand tabular numerical data such as spreadsheets.
    </p>
    <p>
        In todayâ€™s world, where data is ubiquitous, we view data accessibility as a basic human right.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sensory Interface project aims to provide an interface to numerical data for any purpose, be it Scientific
        Research, Software Development, Education etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        This data is typically visualized using graphs, charts, heatmaps etc. You could think of these visualizations as
        the visual interface to the data. We aim to provide a multi-sensory interface to the data. This interface uses
        sound and touch, in addition to the visual channel, as a means to convey the same underlying data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our hope is that by doing this, we will make work in fields such as Scientific Research, Data Science and
        Machine Learning accessible to people with certain disabilities.
