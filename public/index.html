        The Sensory Interface project aims to help people with certain
        disabilities (visual impairment, dyscalculia, ADHD) understand tabular
        numerical data such as spreadsheets.

        In todayâ€™s world, where data is ubiquitous, we view data accessibility
        as a basic human right. The Sensory Interface project aims to provide an
        interface to numerical data for any purpose, be it Scientific Research,
        Software Development, Education etc.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This data is typically visualized using graphs, charts, heatmaps etc.
        You could think of these visualizations as the visual interface to the
        data. We aim to provide a multi-sensory interface to the data. This
        interface uses sound and touch, in addition to the visual channel, as a
        means to convey the same underlying data.
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hope is that by doing this, we will make work in fields such as
        Scientific Research, Data Science and Machine Learning accessible to
        people with certain disabilities.
